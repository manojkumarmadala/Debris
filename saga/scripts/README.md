# Scripts
These scripts are intended purely for developer convenience. They are only used when running the service on the developer laptop.

For information on how services run in production, see the various [chef dependencies](https://github.home.247-inc.net/operations/node_service_247-chef/blob/master/cookbooks/node_service_247/metadata.rb) used by platform services.
